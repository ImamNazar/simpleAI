# simpleAI

I recently developed an interest in artificial intelligence, which led me to attempt to design one. And in this repository, you can discover my initial attempt—or, to put it another way, the first steps toward creating a fully functional AI—which I made by creating a basic AI chatbot that mostly replicates the GPT-3 in Python with the aid of the GPT-3 OPEN AI documentations. You can also find the API Key that was produced from the same source. This is only a crude attempt, but I want to improve upon it and turn this one small line of code into something much better.

Notice: Run the command "pip install openai" when importing the openai library in the VS Code terminal, PowerShell, or even your usual command prompt. If you skip this step, the code won't run properly.

Have some fun by compiling it and testing it in vscode or any text editor terminal that you often use.
